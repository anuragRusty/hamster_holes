# Hamster Holes

Welcome to Hamster Holes, an exciting grid-based game where your goal is to hit as many hamsters as you can within sixty seconds.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/hamster-holes.git
cd hamster-holes
npm install
npm run dev
 ```

## How to Play

The game consists of 36 holes, each of which can randomly spawn a hamster, a snake, or a power-up. To score points, use your cursor to hit the hamsters that appear. But be careful! If you hit a snake, you will lose one of your three lives. As you score more points, the number of snakes that appear will increase, making the game more challenging.

To help you along the way, there are power-ups that can give you an extra life or ten extra seconds of gameplay time. You have sixty seconds to score as many points as possible, collect power-ups, and avoid the snakes.

Good luck and have fun playing Hamster Holes!
